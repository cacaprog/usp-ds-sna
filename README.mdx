## Introduction to Network Analysis {#introduction}

Network analysis is a powerful analytical approach that studies relationships and connections between entities. In the context of data science, it provides insights into complex systems by modeling them as networks of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (links). This methodology has become increasingly valuable across diverse domains, from social media analysis to biological systems, financial networks, and transportation systems.

### Why Network Analysis Matters for Data Scientists

Network analysis offers unique advantages that traditional statistical methods often miss:

- **Relational Insights**: Captures the structure of relationships, not just individual attributes
- **Pattern Discovery**: Reveals hidden patterns in complex interconnected systems
- **Predictive Power**: Enables predictions based on network structure and position
- **System Understanding**: Provides holistic view of how components interact within systems
- **Scalable Analysis**: Can handle massive datasets with millions of nodes and edges

### Historical Context

Network analysis has roots in graph theory (Euler, 1736) and sociology (sociometry in the 1930s). The field exploded with the advent of computational power and big data, particularly with the analysis of the World Wide Web, social networks, and biological networks.

## Fundamental Concepts {#fundamentals}

### Basic Terminology

**Graph (Network)**: A mathematical structure consisting of nodes and edges
- **Node (Vertex)**: Individual entities in the network
- **Edge (Link)**: Connections between nodes
- **Directed Graph**: Edges have direction (A → B)
- **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction (A ↔ B)
- **Weighted Graph**: Edges have associated weights or strengths

### Graph Representation

Networks can be represented in several ways:

**Adjacency Matrix**: An n×n matrix where entry (i,j) = 1 if there's an edge between nodes i and j
```
    A B C D
A [ 0 1 1 0 ]
B [ 1 0 1 1 ]
C [ 1 1 0 0 ]
D [ 0 1 0 0 ]
```

**Edge List**: Simple list of connected node pairs
```
[(A,B), (A,C), (B,C), (B,D)]
```

**Adjacency List**: Each node paired with its neighbors
```
A: [B, C]
B: [A, C, D]
C: [A, B]
D: [B]
```

### Mathematical Foundations

**Graph Theory Basics**:
- A graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges
- |V| = n (number of nodes), |E| = m (number of edges)
- Maximum edges in simple graph: n(n-1)/2 for undirected, n(n-1) for directed

## Types of Networks {#network-types}

### By Structure

**Simple Networks**

### By Direction

**Undirected Networks**
- Symmetric relationships
- Examples: friendship networks, protein interactions

**Directed Networks**
- Asymmetric relationships
- Examples: web links, citation networks, Twitter follows

### By Node Types

**Unipartite Networks**
- All nodes are of the same type
- Example: person-to-person social network

**Bipartite Networks**

## Network Metrics and Measures {#metrics}

### Node-Level Metrics

**Degree Centrality**
